# BankingChatbot

This repo analyses Small Language Models with its efficient fine-tuning, LoRA based, on a Banking Retrieval Dataset.
Besides that, it includes RAG implementation to bridge the gap between tuning and dynamic information changes.

Any comments, error fixes, or improvements are welcome!
Thanks!
