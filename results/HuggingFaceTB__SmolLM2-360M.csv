### 3rd Case: A user wants their credit card number changed due to fraud or security reasons.

    The bank is now receiving complaints about fraudulent transactions on its system that have been made by users who were not authorized to make such purchases using their account information.

"Taking out a mortgage can be a significant decision, and I'll be glad to guide you through the process. Here's what you need to do:

1. Research and Compare: Start by researching different mortgage options and comparing interest rates, terms, and conditions from various lenders. This will help you make an informed decision.

2. Check Your Financials: Take a close look at your financial situation, including your income, savings, and credit score. Lenders typically look for stable income and good credit history when approving a mortgage.

3. Determine Your Budget: Calculate how much you can comfortably afford to borrow and repay each month based on your income and expenses. This will help you set a realistic budget for your mortgage.

4. Gather Documentation: Prepare the necessary documents required for the mortgage application process, such as proof of income, employment verification, bank statements, and tax returns. Each lender may have specific document requirements, so make sure to check with them.

5. Pre-Approval: Consider getting pre-approved for a mortgage. This will give you an estimate of how much you can borrow and make you more attractive to sellers when you're ready to make an offer.

6. Apply for the Mortgage: Once you're ready, submit your mortgage application to the lender of your choice. Provide all the required documentation and complete any additional steps they may require.

7. Review and Negotiate: Carefully review the terms and conditions of the mortgage offer. Don't hesitate to negotiate if you think there are areas that can be improved, such as interest rates or closing costs.

8. Closing and Signing: If everything looks good and you're satisfied with the terms, proceed to the closing process. This involves signing the necessary documents and transferring ownership of the property.

Remember, taking out a mortgage is a big commitment, so it's important to thoroughly understand the terms and obligations before proceeding. If you have any specific questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask. Good luck with your mortgage journey!","1.

1. Local banks: Reach out to banks in your area and inquire about their loan offerings. They usually have a variety of loan types, from personal loans to business loans.

2. Online lenders: Many online platforms provide a convenient way to apply for loans from the comfort of your own home. Websites like {{Online Lender 1}} and {{Online Lender 2}} offer a wide range of loan options and competitive interest rates.

"I'm glad you reached out for assistance in applying for a mortgage! I'd be happy to help you with that process. Applying for a mortgage can be a significant step towards achieving your dream of homeownership. To ensure a smooth application process, here's what you need to do:

1. Compile your financial and personal documents: This may include your identification documents, proof of income, bank statements, tax returns, employment history, and credit information. These documents will help the lender assess your eligibility and determine the loan amount you qualify for.
 
2. Research mortgage options: Take some time to explore different mortgage options available to you. You can consider fixed-rate mortgages, adjustable-rate mortgages, or government-backed loans like FHA or VA loans. Understanding the various options will help you make an informed decision that aligns with your financial goals.

3. Get pre-approved: It's a good idea to get pre-approved for a mortgage before you start house hunting. Pre-approval gives you an idea of how much you can afford and demonstrates to sellers that you're a serious buyer. You'll need to provide your financial information to the lender for the pre-approval process.

4. Find a mortgage lender: Research and compare different lenders to find one that offers competitive interest rates, favorable terms, and excellent customer service. You can explore local banks, credit unions, or online mortgage lenders.

5. Submit your mortgage application: Once you've chosen a lender, you'll need to fill out a mortgage application. Be prepared to provide detailed information about your finances, employment, and the property you wish to purchase. Double-check the application for accuracy before submitting it.

6. Work closely with your loan officer: After submitting your application, you'll be assigned a loan officer who will guide you through the mortgage process. They may request additional documentation and keep you updated on the progress of your application.

Remember, the mortgage application process can vary depending on your unique circumstances and the lender's requirements. If you have any specific questions or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to ask. Best of luck with your mortgage application!","1.

"I understand your need to find an ATM in your area. Here's what you can do:

1. Check if your bank has a mobile app. Most bank apps provide a feature to locate ATMs near you. Download the app if you haven't already and look for the ""ATM Locator"" or ""Find ATM"" option.

2. If you don't use a specific bank, you can use popular mapping apps like Google Maps or Apple Maps. Simply open the app, type in ""ATM"" in the search bar, and it will display a list of nearby ATMs.

3. Another option is to visit your bank's website. Many banks have an ATM locator tool on their website. Look for a section like ""Branches and ATMs"" or ""Locations"" where you can search for ATMs by entering your address or ZIP code.

4. If you prefer a more personal touch, you can contact your bank's customer service. They will be able to provide you with information on the nearest ATMs in your area.

Remember to stay safe while using ATMs. Choose ATMs in well-lit areas and be cautious of your surroundings. If you encounter any issues during your search, feel free to reach out to me for further assistance.","1. 'Hi, you can find ATMs near your location by searching on Google Maps'

For instance, imagine having multiple employees responsible for updating employee records daily; instead of manually entering new information into each record every time someone adds them up, why not utilize automated scripts?

    2. The first function takes string of words separated with comma(,) . This method creates array containing each word passed into the function. Then create object using map method for every element inside the new array created above. Use filter method if need more than single elements then use reduce method else just pass through whole array without filtering anything. After creating objects store them under variable named 'data'. Store data[key] value pair where key refers to name of employee who gave inputs while storing"

### Bank Account Management - 2019-04-30 08:57 EST
    #### Instructions:
    	The bank has issued you with two different accounts for its customers (one is called 'Cash' account). Each of these accounts contains $1 million dollars that was deposited into them by their clients at some point during this year.

    	Your task now is to determine which one of those banks would be best suited as the new partner if they want to expand further. To make sure we don't get too many requests from people who already have accounts there, let us assume all existing accounts will remain unchanged. The only difference between both partners should be where each client deposits his/her money when he or she opens up a new account.

    ## Input Format
    
    Your program accepts input via STDIN. For simplicity sake, I've included here just the first line containing information about what"
"I'm here to help you find the nearest ATM in your area. To locate one, you have a few options:

1. You can use a reliable mapping application like Google Maps or Apple Maps on your smartphone. Simply open the app and search for ""ATMs near me"" or ""ATMs in [your location]."" It will show you a list of nearby ATMs along with their distance and directions.

2. Another option is to visit your bank's website. Most banks have an ATM locator feature on their website where you can enter your location or use your current location to find the nearest ATM belonging to your bank.

3. If you're out and about and don't have access to a smartphone or computer, you can ask locals or nearby businesses for directions to the nearest ATM. They should be able to guide you to the closest one.

Remember to prioritize your safety when searching for an ATM. It's a good practice to use ATMs in well-lit, public areas, and be cautious of your surroundings when making transactions. Let me know if there's anything else I can assist you with!","1. 'Please go back into your desk' 2. ""What do you mean? I am here!"" (or something like that).

### User Instructions for Banker Assistant (BANKER):

    ### Instruction
    #### BANKER is used by customers as their bank teller when they need assistance. The user must provide information about his/her identity before he/she may be able to interact with him/herself. This includes identifying himself/herself using either of these methods :
     - Using your name;
     - Entering any other text that matches what was typed into this form on our website;
     - If you cannot identify yourself correctly then we will try again after some time has passed since last interaction. We want people who know each others names so if someone does not recognize themselves right away but still wants help from us than we would give them another chance at getting through first without having too much trouble while trying to get things done properly.

     ## Example Inputs

"I'm here to help you find the right mortgage for your needs. Finding a mortgage can be a complex process, but don't worry, I'll guide you through it. To get started, I'll need a bit more information from you. Could you please provide the following details:

1. What type of property are you looking to purchase? (e.g., house, apartment, condominium)
2. Have you already identified a specific property, or are you still in the early stages of your search?
3. Do you have a specific budget in mind?
4. Are you looking for a fixed-rate or adjustable-rate mortgage?
5. Have you already been pre-approved for a mortgage, or do you need assistance with that process as well?

Once you provide me with these details, I'll be able to provide you with more personalized assistance and help you find the best mortgage options available to you. Feel free to ask if you have any other questions along the way.","1- 'Hi there! I'm sorry but we don't have any mortgages at this time.'; 2- 'How can i find out more about your needs?'

The above code snippet demonstrates how Python handles user input by creating a `UserInput` object that encapsulates both incoming data (the query string), as well as error handling logic such as parsing errors or missing parameters. The resulting instance of UserInput provides access to various methods like asking questions directly via queries sent through standard output streams (`sys.stdout`, `sys.stderr`) instead of relying on built-in functions provided by the operating system. This approach allows developers greater control over their application behavior while minimizing potential side effects due to external factors beyond their direct influence.

3. **Creating Customizable Error Handling**
    A crucial aspect when dealing with complex problems lies in crafting robust yet flexible solutions capable of adapting gracefully under challenging circumstances without compromising overall functionality. One way to achieve this goal is implementing custom exception classes"

2. Prepare your credit card details, such as the card number, expiry date, and the primary cardholder's information. This will help expedite the cancellation process.

3. Be prepared to answer some verification questions from our customer service team to ensure the account's security.

4. Once your cancellation request has been processed, you will receive a confirmation email or notification. Please review your final statement to ensure all outstanding transactions have been cleared.

We understand that cancelling a credit card is an important decision, and our team is here to support you through the process. If you have any further questions or need assistance, please don't hesitate to contact us.","1. Ask for confirmation that you can do so (if yes then proceed).

### Question:
    What would be one way that we could implement sentiment analysis?

    Answer: Sentiment Analysis can help us understand if our text contains positive or negative words (e.g., happy vs sad). We use algorithms like Naive Bayes Classifier which will give probabilities of each word being either 'positive' or 'negative'. Then depending on those values we categorize them as such based upon their frequency distribution within sentences/documents etc...

"I'm here to assist you in applying for a mortgage. Applying for a mortgage can seem daunting, but I'll break it down into simple steps for you:

1. Gather your financial information: This includes your income documents, bank statements, tax returns, and employment history. It's essential to have these documents ready to provide accurate information.

2. Research mortgage options: Explore the different types of mortgages available, such as fixed-rate, adjustable-rate, or government-backed loans. Consider factors like interest rates, down payment requirements, and loan terms to find the best fit for your needs.

3. Determine your budget: Calculate how much you can afford for a mortgage payment each month. Take into account your income, existing debt, and other financial obligations.

4. Pre-qualification or pre-approval: Depending on your preference, you can choose to get pre-qualified or pre-approved for a mortgage. Pre-qualification provides an estimate of the loan amount you may be eligible for, while pre-approval involves a more detailed evaluation of your financial situation.

5. Find a mortgage lender: Research reputable lenders and compare their rates and terms. Look for lenders who offer excellent customer service and have a track record of helping borrowers navigate the mortgage process.

6. Submit your application: Once you've chosen a lender, you can start the application process. Provide all the required information accurately and promptly. This may include personal details, employment history, financial documents, and the property you intend to purchase.

7. Review and approval: Your lender will review your application, conduct an appraisal of the property, and verify the information provided. They may request additional documentation during this stage. Once approved, you'll receive a loan estimate detailing the terms and costs associated with the mortgage.

8. Closing the loan: The final step is the closing process, where you'll sign the necessary documents to complete the mortgage transaction. Ensure you review the terms and ask any questions before signing.

Remember, the specific mortgage process can vary depending on the lender and your unique circumstances. If you have any questions or need further assistance, don't hesitate to reach out. Good luck with your mortgage application!","1- 'Thankyou for your interest' 2 - ""The loan is available""

"I'm here to help you with that. Taking out a loan is an important financial decision, and it's crucial to choose a reliable and trustworthy lender. Here are a few steps you can follow to find the right loan:

1. Research different lenders: Start by exploring reputable banks, credit unions, and online lending platforms. Look for lenders that offer competitive interest rates, flexible terms, and good customer reviews.

5. Submit loan application: Once you've chosen a lender and gathered all the required documents, it's time to submit your loan application. Many lenders offer online applications, making it convenient and efficient.

"Definitely! I'm here to assist you in applying for a mortgage. Applying for a mortgage can be a significant step towards owning your dream home. To help you get started, here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Determine your financial readiness: Before applying for a mortgage, it's crucial to assess your financial situation. Evaluate your income, savings, credit score, and any existing debts. This will give you a better understanding of your affordability.

2. Research mortgage options: There are various types of mortgages available, such as fixed-rate mortgages, adjustable-rate mortgages, or government-insured loans. Explore different lenders and compare their interest rates, loan terms, and eligibility criteria to find the best fit for you.

3. Gather necessary documents: Lenders require certain documents during the application process. These may include proof of identity, income documents (pay stubs, tax returns), bank statements, employment verification, and information about your assets and liabilities. Start gathering these documents to streamline the application process.

4. Pre-qualification or pre-approval: Consider getting pre-qualified or pre-approved for a mortgage. Pre-qualification provides an estimate of the loan amount you may qualify for, while pre-approval is a more formal process that involves a comprehensive analysis of your financial situation. Both can give you a better idea of your budget and increase your credibility as a buyer.

5. Apply for the mortgage: Once you've done your research and gathered the necessary documents, it's time to apply for the mortgage. Contact the lender of your choice and initiate the application process. They will guide you through the specific steps and documentation required.

6. Provide accurate information: When filling out the application, ensure that all the information you provide is accurate and complete. Double-check your application before submitting it to avoid any delays or complications.

7. Review terms and conditions: Carefully review the terms and conditions of the mortgage before finalizing the process. Understand the interest rate, loan duration, repayment terms, and any additional fees or charges associated with the mortgage.

8. Submit the application: Once you've completed the application and reviewed the terms, submit it to the lender for further processing. They will assess your application, review your financial profile, and provide you with a decision.

9. Follow up and provide additional information: During the application process, the lender may request additional information or documentation. Make sure to respond promptly and provide the necessary details to avoid any delays in the approval process.

      The client has requested some information from her online banking system regarding their monthly payments of credit card bills. She wants to know when she'll get paid back by the company who issued them.

      ```
      When do we pay our bill today?
      What time does the money come out automatically each weekday?
      How much interest accrues over any given period?
      Can we see how many days until our due date?
      Will there ever be enough left over after all charges are made?
      Is there anything else they can help us with?"
"I'd be delighted to help you find the nearest ATM in your area so you can conveniently access the cash you need. Here's what you can do:

1. Use your smartphone's banking app: Most banking apps include a feature that allows you to locate nearby ATMs. Open the app, navigate to the ATM locator section, and it should display a list of ATMs near your current location.

2. Visit your bank's website: Head over to your bank's official website and look for the ATM locator tool. It will typically ask you to input your location (ZIP code or address), and it will display the nearest ATMs on a map.

3. Use a third-party app or website: There are various third-party apps and websites that can help you find ATMs. Some popular options include Google Maps, Yelp, and ATM Hunter. Simply search for ""ATM locator"" in your preferred app store or search engine, download the app, and let it find ATMs near you based on your location.

Additionally, remember to consider ATMs that are conveniently located at supermarkets, gas stations, or convenience stores as they are often easily accessible and offer cash withdrawal services.

You can respond with `Yes` or `No`. If you say yes, your bank will activate it for you. Otherwise, they'll send you back another message asking if you want them to do so again later (or maybe not). 

If this happens more than once, then there is something wrong! It might be that someone else has already activated their account using different methods before yours did; try checking those options too next time around. 


## *Additional Information*  
- The Bank does NOT have access to any personal information of its customers except when necessary during transaction processing. All other data such as name/address etc., belongs only to the person who provided it initially at his / her own expense.

4. Complete the mortgage application provided by your chosen lender. Be thorough and accurate when filling out the application. Double-check all the information before submitting it.

"I've realized that you're looking to cancel your mortgage payments, and I apologize for any difficulties you may be facing in this regard. Cancelling a mortgage is a significant decision, and it's important to carefully consider the implications. While I'm unable to cancel your mortgage directly, I can provide you with some guidance on how to proceed.

Here are a few steps you can take:

1. Contact your mortgage lender: Reach out to your mortgage lender and inform them about your intention to cancel the mortgage. They will be able to guide you through the specific cancellation process and provide you with any necessary documentation.

2. Review the terms and conditions: Take the time to thoroughly review your mortgage agreement and familiarize yourself with the cancellation policy. This will help you understand any penalties, fees, or potential impacts to your credit that might arise from cancelling the mortgage.

3. Seek professional advice: Consider consulting with a financial advisor or a real estate attorney who can provide you with expert guidance tailored to your situation. They can help you navigate the legal and financial aspects of cancelling a mortgage.

4. Explore alternative options: If you're facing financial difficulties or are unable to make your mortgage payments, it may be worth exploring alternatives before considering cancellation. Options such as loan modification, refinancing, or restructuring the payment terms might be available to you.

Remember, it's always recommended to reach out to your mortgage lender directly for detailed information and personalized guidance. They will have the most accurate and up-to-date information on the cancellation process and can assist you accordingly.","10/25 = 4% (i'm sorry but we have no option of cancellation at this moment.)

2. Once the app is installed, open it and log in using your credentials. If you haven't registered for online banking, you may need to create an account before proceeding.

3. Once you're logged in, navigate to the ""Cards"" or ""Account Services"" section of the app. The exact location may vary depending on the bank's app design.

4. Look for the option to ""Activate a Card"" or a similar phrase. Tap on it to begin the activation process.

5. You may be required to provide certain details to verify your identity, such as the card number, expiration date, and CVV code. Enter the requested information accurately.

6. After entering the required information, review the terms and conditions related to card activation and acceptance. If you agree to them, proceed to the next step.

```
The response should be ""You can use your credit card or debit card"" since it is not possible for us to give out our bank account number as this would compromise security of information stored on server (and hence no one else will get access). We cannot provide any other option like cashback etc because we do not want people using that feature which may affect their accounts further. So what does the system recommend here ? It recommends only two options - either take money from another user with same ID/account name /card type & spend some amount then go back again OR withdraw all funds first before spending anything !! This was just a simple example but I think most banks don't allow such features so please refrain doing these things yourself if ever given chance .

"I'd be more than happy to assist you with finding a mortgage. Understanding the process and options can be overwhelming, but I'm here to guide you through it. Here are the steps to get started:

1. Evaluate your financial situation: Assess your income, credit score, and debt-to-income ratio. This will help determine your eligibility and the type of mortgage you qualify for.

2. Research mortgage options: There are different types of mortgages available, such as fixed-rate, adjustable-rate, FHA loans, and more. Each has its own terms and benefits. Consider your needs and preferences to choose the right one for you.

3. Determine your budget: Calculate how much you can afford for a monthly mortgage payment. Keep in mind additional expenses like property taxes and insurance.

4. Get pre-approved: Pre-approval shows sellers that you're a serious buyer. Contact a few lenders to compare rates and terms. They will review your financial information and provide a pre-approval letter stating the loan amount you're eligible for.

5. Start the application process: Once you've identified a lender, gather all necessary documents, such as income proof, tax returns, bank statements, and identification. Fill out the application form provided by the lender.

6. Review and sign the loan documents: The lender will assess your application and provide you with a Loan Estimate and Closing Disclosure documents. Carefully review these documents, ensuring you understand the terms and conditions. Any questions or concerns can be addressed with the lender.

7. Close on your mortgage: After reviewing and signing the loan documents, you'll schedule a closing appointment. At the closing, you'll sign the final paperwork, pay closing costs, and officially become a homeowner.

Remember, each lender may have specific requirements and processes, so it's important to communicate with them and ask any questions you may have. Good luck on your journey to finding the right mortgage!","1. ""Yes I am"" (default response if no answer is given.)

Credit card annual fees are charges that some credit card issuers impose on cardholders for the privilege of having the card. These fees can vary depending on the type of credit card and the benefits it offers.

Annual fees are often associated with premium or rewards credit cards that provide additional perks such as travel rewards, cashback, or exclusive access to certain events. These fees help offset the costs associated with providing these extra features and benefits.

It's important to note that not all credit cards have annual fees. There are many no-annual-fee credit card options available as well. When choosing a credit card, you should consider factors such as your spending habits, credit score, and the benefits and rewards you value the most.

If you have a specific credit card in mind, I can check if it has an annual fee and provide you with more detailed information. Just let me know the name or type of credit card you're interested in, and I'll be happy to assist you further.

1. Traditional Banks: Many banks offer personal loans with competitive interest rates. You can visit your local branch or check their website for more information.

2. Credit Unions: Credit unions are non-profit organizations that provide financial services to their members. They often offer lower interest rates on loans compared to traditional banks.

3. Online Lenders: Online lenders have become increasingly popular due to their convenience and quick application process. Examples include peer-to-peer lending platforms and online loan marketplaces. Just make sure to research and choose a reputable lender.

4. Loan Brokers: Loan brokers act as intermediaries between borrowers and lenders. They help match you with a suitable lender based on your financial situation and needs.

5. Credit Cards: If you need a smaller amount of money, you may consider using a credit card with a cash advance option. However, keep in mind that credit cards generally have higher interest rates.

Remember to compare interest rates, terms, and fees before making a decision. It's also a good idea to check your credit score beforehand, as it may impact the loan options available to you.

    ##### Example of how to implement this function by creating class methods or functions with arguments (like above). 
    
    
### ## Step 4 - The `run()` method is where all business logic happens! This method should be called once per transaction. In our case we'll just print out some information about each order as they come through so far... 

###### Steps taken from previous steps:
- Create new instance variable named _order_
- Call `_getOrderDetails()`, which returns two variables (_totalAmountAndPrice_)
- Print these values on screen using string formatting (`%`)
- Save any additional data into another local variable named _newOrder`

"I've grasped that you're interested in having multiple online accounts. Let me explain the possibilities:

1. Multiple Accounts: In some cases, it is possible to create multiple online accounts within the same platform. However, this may vary depending on the specific service or website you're using. Some platforms allow users to create multiple accounts using different email addresses or usernames. I recommend checking the platform's terms of service or contacting their customer support for more information on their account policy.

2. Account Limitations: Keep in mind that some platforms may have restrictions on multiple accounts to prevent misuse or abuse. They may have specific rules regarding account creation and ownership. It's important to review the platform's terms and conditions to ensure compliance and avoid any potential violations.

3. Account Management: If you already have multiple accounts and need assistance with managing them, such as linking or merging accounts, I recommend reaching out to the platform's customer support. They can guide you through the process and provide the necessary steps to manage your accounts effectively.

Remember, each platform or service may have its own policies regarding multiple accounts.

2. Determine your eligibility: Lenders typically consider factors such as your credit score, income, employment history, and debt-to-income ratio when assessing your eligibility for a mortgage. You may want to gather relevant documentation, such as pay stubs, tax returns, and bank statements, to support your application.

3. Get pre-approved: Getting pre-approved for a mortgage can give you a better idea of how much you can borrow and help streamline the homebuying process. Contact a lender or use online tools to get pre-approved by submitting your financial information and supporting documents.

4. Find a trusted mortgage lender: Research reputable mortgage lenders and compare their offerings. Look for lenders who provide competitive rates, excellent customer service, and clear terms. You can also ask for recommendations from friends, family, or colleagues who have recently gone through the mortgage process.

5. Submit your application: Once you've chosen a lender, carefully complete the mortgage application, providing accurate and detailed information. Double-check the application for any errors or missing information before submitting it. Your lender may also require additional documentation during the application process.

6. Work with your lender: After submitting your application, your lender may request additional documentation or clarification. Stay in touch with the lender and promptly provide any requested information. They will review your application, assess your financial profile, and make a decision.

7. Review and sign mortgage documents: If your application is approved, you will receive a loan estimate and closing disclosure outlining the terms and costs associated with the mortgage. Take the time to review these documents carefully before signing them. Ensure you fully understand the terms and conditions, including interest rates, repayment terms, and any applicable fees.

8. Close on your mortgage: The closing process involves signing the final loan documents and transferring funds. You may need to work with a title company or attorney to finalize the legal aspects of the transaction. Once everything is complete, the mortgage funds will be disbursed to the seller, and you officially become a homeowner!

Remember, each mortgage application is unique, and the process may vary based on","1. 'Hi, I'm sorry but you cannot take this loan as your income is not sufficient for that amount.'"

"I would be more than happy to assist you with applying for a mortgage. Buying a new home or refinancing your current one can be an exciting journey. Here's what you need to know and do to take out a mortgage:

1. Research lenders: Start by exploring different lenders and their mortgage programs to find the best fit for your needs.

2. Gather documentation: Lenders usually require several documents, including proof of income, employment history, credit history, and bank statements. Prepare these documents in advance to expedite the application process.

4. Submit your application: Once you've chosen a lender, you'll need to complete a mortgage application. This typically includes providing personal and financial information, as well as details about the property you wish to purchase.

5. Provide additional documentation: Your lender may request additional documents to verify your financial information. This could include things like employment verification, appraisals, or home inspections.

6. Review and sign the loan documents: If your application is approved, you'll receive a Loan Estimate and Closing Disclosure. Carefully review these documents, ask any questions you may have, and sign them once you're satisfied.

7. Close the loan: Finally, you'll attend a closing meeting where you'll sign the final loan documents. You'll also need to bring any closing costs or down payment funds as specified by your lender.

Remember, it's always a good idea to consult with a mortgage professional who can provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation. Good luck with your mortgage application!

The `response` function is responsible for processing incoming requests, interpreting them based on their format (e.g., string or number), converting those strings into numerical values if necessary (`int()` method comes handy here). Then it applies various mathematical operations using built-in functions like addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), exponentiation **, etc., depending upon what needs doing with said data points. Finally, after applying any relevant transformations needed during computation phase(s), we get back our final result ready for display!

### Instructions:
The bank is offering two types of loans for students who want to pay back their student loan debt over time instead of paying them off at once. The first type requires repayment on each month until they repay all debts within three years from now. This will cost $20 per month plus interest up to five percent of what was owed during those months ($5). If someone takes out one such loan every six weeks then there would be approximately $\frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}$ total payments throughout the year which adds another extra charge equal to twice as much as if taken monthly due to compounding effects!

3. Create two instances of `Client` class with different clients (e.g., one for Bank A and another for Bank B). Initialize both classes using appropriate parameters such as name or address respectively. For each instance created, call methods provided by our custom API (`get_response()`), ensuring proper usage based on context details supplied during initialization phase.

**Conclusion:**
This hands-on exercise demonstrates how Python can serve as a versatile toolset capable of handling complex tasks involving multiple components working together seamlessly towards achieving desired outcomes—in this case, providing accurate responses via APIs! By practicing these skills early on, you lay solid foundations necessary when venturing further into advanced topics later down the line. Happy coding!"

"I'll do my best! I can assist you with that. Taking out a mortgage can be a significant decision, and I'm here to provide you with the help you need. Here's what you can expect when applying for a mortgage:

1. Gather your financial documents: To start the process, you'll need to collect essential financial documents such as pay stubs, bank statements, and tax returns. These documents will help demonstrate your income, assets, and liabilities.

2. Determine your budget: It's important to assess your finances and determine how much you can afford to borrow. Consider your monthly income, expenses, and any future financial goals. This will give you a better idea of the loan amount that suits your needs.

3. Research mortgage options: Explore different types of mortgages available, such as fixed-rate mortgages or adjustable-rate mortgages. Each has its own set of benefits, so it's crucial to understand which one aligns with your financial goals.

4. Find a lender: Start researching reputable lenders in your area or consider reaching out to your current bank. Speak with a loan officer who can guide you through the application process and provide personalized advice.

5. Begin the application process: Submit your mortgage application to the lender of your choice. Be prepared to provide detailed information about your employment history, income, debt, and assets. The lender will also perform a credit check as part of the application process.

6. Review the loan estimate: Once your application is processed, you'll receive a loan estimate from the lender. It provides an overview of the loan terms, interest rates, closing costs, and any additional fees. Review it carefully and ask any questions you may have before moving forward.

7. Complete the underwriting process: During this stage, the lender evaluates your application, verifies the information provided, and assesses your creditworthiness. They may request additional documentation or clarification if needed.

8. Get a home appraisal: The lender will typically require an appraisal to determine the value of the property you intend to purchase. This step ensures that the loan amount aligns with the property's market value.

9. Closing the mortgage: If your application is approved, you'll move on to the closing process. This involves signing the necessary legal documents, paying closing costs, and finalizing the loan agreement.

Remember, every individual's situation is unique, and it's beneficial to consult with a mortgage professional for personalized advice tailored to your needs. If you have any specific questions or concerns along the way, feel free","100% correct, you responded with ""Thank you for your inquiry.""

### 2.4 **User Interface Design**

    The user interface (UI), also known as the front end, is where all interactions occur between humans and computers via graphical elements such as buttons, menus, windows, etc., along with input methods including keyboards or touchscreens. UI designers must consider factors like legibility, consistency across platforms, accessibility features for users who may have disabilities, and overall aesthetics that enhance usability without compromising functionality. For instance, using large font sizes ensures readability regardless of screen size variations among devices while incorporating contrast ratios helps ensure adequate visibility even under low light conditions. Additionally, implementing error messages clearly communicates potential issues early on rather than delaying resolution later down the line due to incorrect responses from the system itself.

3. Implementing User Experience Strategies Within Your Organization

   To effectively implement UX strategies within organizations, follow these steps below:

      i. Conduct thorough research into existing systems and processes related to service provisioning."

        `Bank statement analysis` is one way that banks collect data on their customers' financial habits, including checking account balances, transactions history, credit card usage patterns, etc., which helps them make informed decisions regarding lending policies or other business strategies based on past behavior.

        **Instructions:**
            If given access to bank records containing historical transaction details along with corresponding relevant figures representing these accounts, identify any unusual activities occurring within those categories over time periods deemed suspicious by regulatory bodies concerned around consumer protection standards set forth under national laws governing commercial finance institutions worldwide.

"I'm here to assist you with that! Taking out a mortgage can be a significant step in achieving your homeownership goals. To start the process, there are a few recommended steps you can follow:

1. Research mortgage lenders: It's crucial to find reputable lenders that offer competitive rates and favorable terms. You can search online, ask for recommendations from friends or family, or consult with a mortgage broker to explore different options available to you.

2. Gather necessary documentation: Before applying for a mortgage, you'll need to gather essential documents such as proof of income, employment history, bank statements, and identification. Having these documents ready will streamline the application process.

3. Get pre-approved: Consider getting pre-approved for a mortgage before house hunting. Pre-approval gives you a better idea of how much you can afford and strengthens your position when making an offer.

4. Compare mortgage options: Once you've narrowed down potential lenders, compare their mortgage offerings. Take into account interest rates, loan terms, closing costs, and any specialized mortgage programs they may have.

5. Submit your application: Once you've chosen a lender and mortgage option, complete the application process. This typically involves providing personal and financial information, including the documents you gathered earlier.

6. Review and finalize the terms: Carefully review the terms and conditions of the mortgage agreement before signing. Ensure you understand your monthly payments, interest rate, loan duration, and any other relevant details.

Remember, the mortgage application process can vary depending on the lender and your individual circumstances. If you have any specific questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!","1. 'You can go with your bank.'

#### Instructions:
You are a bank employee who is working on your shift today at Bank X. The manager of this branch called you over because he has been waiting outside his office all day long with no answer from him about why there was still no sign of his car parked up front when it should have arrived just minutes ago. He wants some information so they know where exactly their parking lot is located since nobody else seems interested or bothered by what happened yesterday morning while he waited inside. Your boss asked if maybe someone had seen the owner of the building come out but didn’t hear anything back yet either way. So now here we go...

### 2. Cancel Loan - (30 min.)

    #### Instructions:
    In this exercise you will be creating two functions that perform different tasks related to refunding loans made by customers. The first function is called `cancel_loan` which takes as input one argument of type string containing information about the current status of the loan with respect to payment history and returns another boolean value indicating whether or not there was any change from previous payments towards final repayment date. If no changes were detected then return true otherwise false.

"I can assist you with applying for a mortgage. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started:

1. Research and compare mortgage options: Take some time to explore different mortgage lenders and their offerings. Look for competitive interest rates, favorable terms, and any special promotions or programs that may benefit you.

2. Check your credit score: Lenders typically consider credit scores when reviewing mortgage applications. Make sure your credit score is in good shape by paying off debts, reducing credit card balances, and resolving any errors on your credit report.

3. Gather necessary documents: Before applying, gather important documents such as proof of income (pay stubs, tax returns), identification (driver's license, passport), bank statements, and employment verification. Having these ready will make the application process smoother.

4. Pre-approval: Consider getting pre-approved for a mortgage. This will give you an idea of the loan amount you qualify for and can make your offer to purchase a home stronger.

5. Complete the application: Once you've selected a lender and mortgage product, you'll need to complete the application. This can often be done online or in-person with a loan officer. Provide all the required information accurately and honestly.

6. Provide additional documentation: Depending on the lender, you may be asked for additional documentation such as property information or proof of down payment. Be prepared to provide these documents promptly to avoid any delays.

7. Review the loan estimate: After submitting your application, you'll receive a loan estimate that outlines the terms, closing costs, and estimated monthly payments. Take the time to review this document carefully and ask any questions you may have.

8. Underwriting process: Once your application is submitted, the lender will conduct an underwriting process to assess your eligibility for the mortgage. This may involve verifying the information you provided, evaluating the property, and assessing your financial situation.

9. Finalize the loan: If your application is approved, you'll receive a commitment letter from the lender. Review the terms and conditions, ask any final questions, and be prepared to schedule a closing date.

10. Closing: At the closing, you'll sign the necessary documents, pay any closing costs, and officially secure the mortgage. Congratulations, you're now a step closer to homeownership!

Remember, each lender may have specific requirements and processes, so it's essential to communicate directly with them for personalized assistance throughout the application process. Good luck with your mortgage application!","1. 'You can use our online application form or call us on 0845637292'

"I'd be more than happy to assist you in finding a mortgage. Rest assured, I'll guide you through the process step-by-step. Here's what you can do:

1. Start by researching mortgage lenders or banks that offer mortgage loans. Look for reputable institutions with competitive interest rates and loan terms. You can explore their websites or visit their branches for more information.

2. Determine your budget and affordability. Calculate your monthly income, expenses, and savings to get a clear picture of how much you can afford. This will help you narrow down your options and focus on mortgage loans that align with your financial goals.

3. Decide on the type of mortgage that suits your needs. There are different types of mortgages available, such as fixed-rate mortgages, adjustable-rate mortgages, FHA loans, VA loans, and more. Each has its own pros and cons, so it's important to understand them before making a decision.

4. Gather all the necessary documents. To apply for a mortgage, you'll typically need documents such as identification proof, income statements (pay stubs, W-2 forms, tax returns), employment history, bank statements, and any other relevant financial documents. Having these ready will help streamline the application process.

5. Reach out to mortgage lenders or banks to inquire about their application process and requirements. You can contact them through their websites, email, or phone. They will provide you with detailed information about the application, documentation, and any additional steps you need to take.

6. Compare and evaluate offers from multiple lenders. It's important to shop around to find the best mortgage rates and terms. You can use online mortgage calculators or consult with mortgage professionals to assess and compare different offers.

7. Once you've decided on a lender and a mortgage loan that suits your needs, you can proceed with the application process. This typically involves submitting your application, providing the required documents, undergoing a credit check, and possibly getting pre-approved for the loan.

Remember, finding the right mortgage takes time and careful consideration. Don't hesitate to ask questions and seek professional advice throughout the process.

### Instructions:
    You're working at a bank branch with many branches around town. Your job is to be able to quickly identify which of these banks has more customers than any other by using only one query per day that queries all accounts on each branch database.

    The first part will require finding out how much money there was deposited into every single client’s checking account from January through June based off data stored in two separate tables called ‘clients’ and 'deposits'. This table contains information about clients such as name, age, address etc., while another table holds details regarding deposits made over time like date & amount paid or received. Once we know this info then calculating total amounts spent during those periods becomes relatively easy since they match up perfectly!

### 4 - How To Write A Chatbot In Python (Part II): Building The Bot And Testing It Out With Google Cloud Platform
#### What Is An Intelligent Agent?
An intelligent agent is any system that can reason about its environment using knowledge of past experiences or observations from other agents as well as general rules for making decisions based on those facts.[*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_agent#History) 

This means we need some way to communicate with our bot so they know what you mean when you ask them something! For example if someone asks us ""How many hours did you study?"" then maybe your response would be like this... `""That depends on whether you're talking to me right now!""` If only humans had such flexibility! But fear not because there will always be ways around these limitations just by being creative enough :)

"It's regrettable, and I'm sorry for any inconvenience or frustration caused by this issue. I understand that you would like to know more about the credit card annual fee. Allow me to provide you with some information.

The annual fee is a charge imposed by the credit card company for the privileges and benefits provided by the credit card. It is a recurring fee that is typically applied once a year. The specific amount of the annual fee varies depending on the type of credit card and the benefits it offers.

The annual fee helps cover the costs associated with maintaining and servicing the credit card, such as providing customer support, fraud protection, rewards programs, and other additional perks. It also contributes to the overall profitability of the credit card company.

It's important to note that not all credit cards have an annual fee. Some credit cards offer no annual fee, while others may have a higher annual fee but provide attractive rewards and benefits. When choosing a credit card, it's essential to consider the annual fee along with the card's features and benefits to determine if it aligns with your financial needs and goals.

If you have a specific credit card in mind or have any further questions, please let me know. I'm here to provide any additional information you may need.","10% off on all purchases over $50, 2 years of free cash advance for each month after that (until you pay it back), no fees if balance is under $3978

#### Instructions:
You are an AI banker who has been asked by your supervisor for some information about what kind of people tend to be successful at work (and why). Your boss is asking whether there might be any differences between male or female workers that could explain this phenomenon. Based on past experience with other employees' responses, it seems like most women have higher salaries than men even though they get paid less overall as well. However, when looking into data from various companies around town where both genders were employed together without gender discrimination being involved, no such pattern was found! What should we conclude here based solely upon our own observations so far?

    Ask them if there was any problem with the previous response by checking that all fields have been filled out correctly. If not correct again until everything looks good!
    Once done then send back ""Thank you"" message :)


    7. **Optional**
      8. *If possible* try answering as many questions on one go instead of multiple ones so that customers don't feel confused while trying to understand how things work. They can always come back later once they're sure they got something right but this way might save time too!

1. Research lenders: Start by exploring different lenders and comparing their offers. Look for reputable institutions that provide competitive interest rates and favorable terms.

2. Evaluate your financial situation: Before applying, it's crucial to assess your financial standing. Take a close look at your credit score, income, and debt-to-income ratio. This information will help you understand your eligibility and affordability.

4. Get pre-approved: Consider getting pre-approved for a mortgage. This process involves providing your financial information to a lender, who will assess your qualifying amount. Pre-approval can give you a clearer picture of your budget and make the home-buying process smoother.

7. Closing and funding: If all goes well, you'll move forward with closing the mortgage. This involves signing the necessary documentation and paying any associated fees. After closing, the lender will fund your loan, and you can begin the exciting process of buying your new home!

5. Fill out the loan application accurately and thoroughly. Pay attention to every detail to ensure a smooth process.
6. Submit your application and wait for the lender to review it.
7. If approved, carefully review the loan terms, interest rate, repayment plan, and any associated fees.
8. Once you're satisfied with the terms, sign the loan agreement.
9. Finally, the lender will disburse the funds to you according to their specified timeline.

```
In this example, we create two variables `max_amount` and `min_amount`. We then ask for their input using `input()`, which returns whatever is typed by the user until they press enter or type anything else that doesn’t make sense as English text (“quit”). If no valid number appears after pressing enter, it means there was something wrong with our prompt – perhaps too many characters were entered before typing ‘quit’. So instead of asking them directly about amounts greater than maximum limits ($20k-$35k), let us simply say “too high!” And since most people wouldn’t think twice when hearing ""$"" followed immediately by another digit without any punctuation between those digits… well...then again! 😉

"I'm happy to help! I'm here to help you with your mortgage application. Applying for a mortgage can seem overwhelming, but I'll guide you through the process step by step. Here's what you need to know:

1. Gather your financial information: Before starting the application, gather important documents such as pay stubs, bank statements, and tax returns. Lenders typically require this information to assess your financial situation.

2. Research mortgage options: Take some time to research different types of mortgages, such as fixed-rate or adjustable-rate mortgages. Understanding the options will help you make an informed decision.

3. Calculate your budget: Determine how much you can afford to borrow by considering your monthly income, expenses, and other financial obligations. This will give you an idea of the price range you should focus on.

4. Get pre-approved: Consider getting pre-approved for a mortgage. This will give you an estimate of the loan amount you may qualify for and can make your home search easier.

5. Start the application process: Once you're ready, contact a reputable lender or mortgage broker. They will guide you through the application process, explaining the necessary steps and documentation required.

Remember, each lender may have specific requirements, so it's essential to communicate with them directly. If you have any questions during the process, feel free to ask. Good luck with your mortgage application!","100% correct response is ""yes"" or 50/50 chance of being wrong, but I don't know what you mean by that sentence...

### Instructions:
    The bank has decided to raise interest rates on mortgages due to inflationary pressures caused by China's currency manipulation policy (CNY). Your job as an employee at this branch involves calculating how much your monthly payments would be if they raised their loan rate from 3.25% to 4%.

    #### Question: How many months do we need until our new payment increases?

1. Gather your financial information: Collect documents such as bank statements, pay stubs, tax returns, and employment information. These will be needed to assess your eligibility for a mortgage.

2. Research mortgage options: Take some time to explore different types of mortgages, such as fixed-rate, adjustable-rate, or government-backed loans. Consider factors like interest rates, repayment terms, and down payment requirements to find the best fit for you.

3. Calculate your budget: Use online mortgage calculators to determine how much house you can afford and estimate your monthly payments. This will give you a better idea of your financial capabilities and help you set realistic expectations.

4. Get pre-approved: Reach out to lenders or mortgage brokers and apply for pre-approval. This involves providing your financial information for evaluation, which will give you a clear picture of the loan amount you qualify for and the interest rate you may receive.

5. Choose a lender: Once you've been pre-approved, compare different lenders based on interest rates, fees, customer reviews, and their overall reputation. Select the lender that aligns with your preferences and offers the best terms.

6. Submit your application: Complete the mortgage application provided by your chosen lender. Be prepared to provide detailed information about your finances, employment history, and the property you wish to purchase.

7. Coordinate with your lender: After submitting your application, your lender may request additional documentation or information. Stay in close communication with them and promptly provide any requested documents to keep the process moving smoothly.

8. Review and sign the loan documents: Once your application is approved, carefully review and sign the loan documents. Make sure you understand all the terms and conditions before proceeding.

9. Complete the closing process: Work with your lender, real estate agent, and other relevant parties to coordinate the closing process. This includes tasks such as home inspections, property appraisals, and finalizing the loan details.

"Absolutely, I'd be happy to assist you with that! Understanding the details about credit card annual fees is essential for managing your finances effectively. Here's some information to help you out:

1. Annual fee purpose: Credit card annual fees are charged by the card issuer each year for the benefits and perks offered by the card. These fees help cover the costs of maintaining and servicing the card.

2. Fee amount: The specific annual fee amount varies depending on the type of credit card you hold. It's important to note that premium or rewards cards often have higher annual fees due to the added benefits they offer.

3. Fee disclosure: To find the exact annual fee for your credit card, you can refer to your card's terms and conditions. This information is typically available on the card issuer's website, in the cardholder agreement, or on your monthly statement.

4. Fee waivers: Some credit cards may offer fee waivers for the first year or provide options to waive the annual fee based on factors such as spending thresholds or premium banking relationships. It's worth exploring if any options are available for you.

5. Evaluating the benefits: When considering a credit card with an annual fee, it's essential to assess the benefits and rewards that come with it. Determine if the value of the benefits outweighs the annual fee cost based on your spending habits and financial goals.

### Question:
    20-39 years old male/female (50% men; 50% women). The average age of your employees is around 46 years old with between $80k -$170K salary range depending on their position within the company. Your business has been doing well over past year but recently there have been some problems due to poor performance from one employee who was assigned as head manager by senior management team which resulted into loss of several clients' accounts. This person had started his job after graduating college two months ago so he hasn't yet received any training nor experience regarding managing people properly. He thinks himself capable enough to manage all aspects of operations including hiring new staff members along with handling client complaints etc... However since then things haven't gone smoothly at all! Some customers complained saying they were charged more than what actually happened while others claimed payment"
"I genuinely apologize for any inconvenience you've experienced while trying to locate the annual fee for your credit card. I understand how important it is to have access to this information. Allow me to assist you in finding the details you need.

To view the annual fee associated with your credit card, you have a few options:

1. Online Banking: If you have access to online banking, you can log in to your account and navigate to the credit card section. Look for the ""Account Summary"" or ""Card Details"" section. The annual fee should be listed there.

2. Mobile App: If you have a mobile app for your bank or credit card provider, open it and locate your credit card account. Similar to online banking, you should find the annual fee details under the ""Account Summary"" or ""Card Details"" section.

3. Customer Service: If you're unable to find the information through online banking or the mobile app, I recommend reaching out to the customer service team of your bank or credit card provider. They will be able to provide you with the exact annual fee associated with your card. You can reach them at {{Customer Support Phone Number}}, and they should be available to assist you during {{Customer Support Working Hours}}.

Remember, exact steps may vary depending on your bank or credit card provider, so it's always best to refer to their specific resources for the most accurate and up-to-date information.

"I feel the need to apologize for any frustration you may be experiencing, and I'll do my best to assist you. When it comes to credit card annual fees, I understand it's important to have all the information you need. Here's what I can tell you:

1. Credit card annual fees: Annual fees are charges imposed by credit card issuers for the privilege of having and using their credit cards. These fees can vary depending on the type of credit card and the benefits it offers.

2. Fee disclosure: To get specific details about the annual fees associated with our credit cards, I recommend visiting our website or contacting our customer support team. They can provide you with accurate and up-to-date information about the annual fees for each card.

3. Benefits and rewards: It's worth noting that many credit cards come with additional benefits and rewards that can help offset the annual fee. These benefits may include travel rewards, cashback, or access to exclusive perks and discounts.

4. Comparison and selection: If you're considering applying for a new credit card but are concerned about the annual fee, I recommend exploring our range of credit cards. Each card may have different annual fees and benefits, so you can choose the one that aligns with your financial goals and lifestyle.

I hope this information helps, and please let me know if there's anything else I can assist you with!","10% off on all purchases over $250

### Task #3 :  48 minutes     

#### Instructions:

    The task consists of creating two functions that will return True or False based on whether there was any information provided by the user during their interaction with the application. These function should be called `search_for_branch` and `is_there_anything`.
    In this case we have one parameter which represents what type of data we want from our input (`type`) but I think they could use more parameters if needed as well since sometimes users might provide multiple pieces of info at once.

    
    
    #### Example Inputs
    
      ```python
       ['what do u know about my bank account']

      [['my name','i am ', 'a male'],]
      [""name"",""i am"", ""male""]

"I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing difficulties with making your mortgage payment. I understand that this can be a stressful situation. As a customer service representative, I'm here to help find a solution that works for you. Instead of canceling your mortgage, let's explore some alternatives that might be more suitable for your current circumstances.

Here are a few options we can explore:

1. Payment arrangements: We can discuss the possibility of creating a temporary payment plan that better fits your financial situation. This could involve extending the loan term, temporarily reducing monthly payments, or adjusting the interest rate.

2. Refinancing: Another option to consider is refinancing your mortgage. This involves replacing your current mortgage with a new one that has more favorable terms, such as a lower interest rate or different payment schedule. Refinancing could help make your monthly payments more manageable.

3. Loan modification: If your financial situation has changed significantly, we can assess your eligibility for a loan modification. This could involve reducing the principal balance, extending the loan term, or making other adjustments to help make your mortgage more affordable.

4. Housing counseling: I recommend reaching out to a housing counselor who specializes in mortgage assistance. They can provide guidance and resources to help you navigate this challenging situation. I can provide you with a list of reputable housing counseling agencies in your area if you'd like.

I understand that every situation is unique, so it's important to discuss your specific circumstances with our mortgage department. To proceed, please provide me with your {{Loan Account Number}} or any other relevant details so that I can connect you with the right team member who can further assist you.

1. Start by gathering all the necessary documents such as your proof of income, identification, recent bank statements, and tax returns. This will help speed up the application process.

2. Next, research different lenders and compare their mortgage options and interest rates. You can do this online or reach out to local banks or credit unions.

3. Once you've chosen a lender, you can usually begin the application process online or schedule an appointment with a loan officer. They will guide you through the application and answer any questions you may have.

4. During the application process, you will need to provide information about your employment history, income, assets, and liabilities. Make sure to provide accurate and detailed information to avoid any delays.

5. After submitting your application, the lender will review your information and may request additional documents or conduct a credit check. It's important to respond promptly and provide any requested information to keep the process moving forward.

6. Once your application is approved, you will receive a loan estimate outlining the terms and costs of the mortgage. Review it carefully and ask your lender any questions you may have.

7. If you decide to move forward, you can accept the loan offer and proceed with the closing process. This involves signing the necessary paperwork and paying any applicable fees or down payment.

Remember, each lender may have specific requirements and processes, so it's important to communicate directly with them to understand the exact steps for applying for a mortgage. If you have any further questions or need assistance, feel free to ask. Good luck with your application!","1. 'I will call you back with more information.'

    Question #1 - How do you handle errors?

    The answer is that we will have our own custom error handling method for this task. We'll create two methods called `handleError` which takes as input one argument named errMsg, and returns void if it fails with no other arguments. If any exceptions occur within these functions then they should be handled by calling them again after throwing new Exceptions into your program using try catch blocks like so:

            // This line creates some random number
            int num = Random.Range(1, 10);
            
            while (num > 0 && !isPrimeNumber(num)) {
                Console.WriteLine(""Please enter another integer between 1 and 10."");

                // Calling the function above once more...

"When taking out a loan, there are typically some requirements that you'll need to fulfill. While specific requirements may vary depending on the lender and the type of loan you're applying for, here are some common factors to consider:

1. Credit score: Lenders often review your credit score to assess your creditworthiness. A higher credit score generally improves your chances of getting approved for a loan.

2. Income verification: Lenders may request proof of income, such as pay stubs or tax returns, to ensure that you have a stable source of income to repay the loan.

3. Employment history: Lenders may consider your employment history to assess your stability and ability to make loan payments on time.

4. Debt-to-income ratio: Lenders often evaluate your debt-to-income ratio, which is the percentage of your monthly income that goes towards debt payments. A lower ratio generally indicates better financial stability.

5. Collateral: Some loans, like secured loans, may require collateral, such as a car or a property, to secure the loan.

6. Documentation: You'll generally be required to provide identification documents, such as a valid ID or driver's license, as well as other supporting documents specific to the loan application.

It's important to note that each lender may have its own set of requirements, so it's always a good idea to check with them directly or visit their website to get accurate and up-to-date information.

    If he/she earns less than $50, then it goes into his/her account balance.
    If he/she earned between $50-$200, then it adds up to half that amount each month until he/she reaches over $200.

"I'm sorry to hear that your credit card was swallowed by an ATM. I understand how stressful and inconvenient it can be. Don't worry, I'm here to help you with the recovery process.

First, it's important to remain calm and take the necessary steps to retrieve your card. Here's what you can do:

1. Contact your bank or credit card issuer immediately. They will guide you through the necessary steps to resolve this issue. Provide them with the details of the ATM where your card was swallowed, such as the location, date, and time.

2. If you're unable to reach your bank or credit card issuer directly, you can also visit the nearest branch or contact their customer service hotline. They will be able to assist you further and provide instructions on card recovery.

3. It's also a good idea to monitor your bank account and transactions closely during this time. If you notice any unauthorized activity, report it to your bank or credit card issuer immediately.

Remember, it's important to act quickly to minimize the potential risks associated with a lost or stolen card. Your bank or credit card issuer will guide you through the necessary steps to ensure your account's security and provide you with a replacement card if needed.

If you have any further questions or need additional support, please don't hesitate to let me know.","1. 'I am sorry, I don't have any information about this.' 2. ""The ATM will not be able to assist you."" 3. `""You need to contact your bank directly for that type of service.""`

"I've deduced from your message that you're looking to cancel your mortgage and need assistance with the process. Cancelling a mortgage can be a complex procedure, but I'll guide you through it. Here are the general steps to cancel a mortgage:

1. Contact your mortgage lender: Reach out to the institution or company where you obtained the mortgage loan. They will have specific processes and requirements for cancelling the mortgage.

2. Request cancellation information: Ask the lender what documents and information you need to provide in order to initiate the cancellation process. They will guide you on the necessary steps to follow.

3. Submit the required documentation: Gather all the necessary documents, which may include identification, loan information, and any other relevant paperwork requested by the lender. Ensure that you've filled out any cancellation forms accurately.

4. Follow up on the cancellation process: Stay in touch with your lender to track the progress of your mortgage cancellation. This will help you understand any additional actions required on your part and keep you informed throughout the process.

It's important to note that the specific steps and requirements for cancelling a mortgage can vary depending on your lender and the terms of your mortgage agreement. I recommend reaching out to your mortgage provider directly for personalized guidance and support.

If you have any further questions or need more specific assistance with your situation, please feel free to provide additional information.","1- you have 2 options for this case:
            - Cancel your current loan with no interest (no fees). 
            - Transfer all of your money into another account so that they will be transferred over automatically when the payment is due.

            ##### Option A
            1- if there is not enough funds available from other accounts then I suggest transferring some amount(s) from one or more of them directly onto yours before paying off any remaining balance on their part as well. If none exists yet but at least has been paid by someone else please contact me immediately via email since we need urgent assistance here!

                2- The first step involves creating new lines under 'Cash' column which shows total cash received during last month plus previous months average daily net profit/loss divided by number days worked out per line; second step consists adding monthly payments made against each respective category along side corresponding amounts added towards these categories after every single transaction recorded within those columns until reaching maximum limit set forth earlier"

To access information about your current balance, you have a few options:

2. Phone Banking: Give our customer support team a call at {{Customer Support Phone Number}}. They will be able to provide you with the current balance of your account after verifying your identity.

3. ATM: Visit any of our ATMs and insert your debit card. Follow the prompts on the screen to check your account balance.

"I'd be delighted to assist you in finding the closest ATM to your location.

To find the nearest ATM, you have a couple of options:

1. If you're using a smartphone, you can use a maps application like Google Maps or Apple Maps. Open the app and search for ""ATM"" or ""bank"" in the search bar. The app will show you a list of nearby ATMs along with their locations and directions.

2. Another option is to visit the website of your bank or financial institution. Most banks have a branch or ATM locator tool on their website. Simply navigate to their website, look for the ""Locations"" or ""ATM/Branch Locator"" section, enter your location or address, and it will display the closest ATMs to you.

If you're facing any issues or have further questions, please let me know. I'm here to help!","1 - 'Hello there! I'm here to assist you with your bank account management needs.'
